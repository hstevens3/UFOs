# Module 12 Challenge 

# UFOs Javascript

## Overview of the Analysis

This challenge is to create a web page that takes a user entry and filters a data table. In order to do this, we covered javascript functions and css styles and simple html.

## Results

The web page "app" allows the user to view a data table of UFO sightings. There are text entry fields (created as list items) that allow the user to filter data based on date, city, state, country or shape. The filters are shown in the image below.

## Summary and Recommendations

When the page loads, all of the data is displayed and then filters are applied. If the user wants to clear the filters, there is no way to do that without refreshing the page. There are other improvements that could be made such as providing a total count in a separate column on the page or as a summary row. Also, there is no error handling such as messages if the user enters invalid values.
